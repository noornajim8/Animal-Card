            <!-- animal's description -->
            <p>The cat (Felis catus) is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal valued for companionship and pest
                control. Known for their agility,, retractable claws, and keen night vision, they are crepuscular
                hunters that sleep 16–18 hours daily. Domesticated for thousands of years, cats are independent yet
                affectionate, communicating through meows, purrs, and body language. </p>
